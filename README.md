> Using GE to accurately analyze scRNA-seq data has many challenges, including technological biases such as the choice of the sequencing platforms, the experimental protocols and conditions. These biases may lead to various confounding factors in interpreting GE data5. SNVs, on the other hand, are less prone to these issues given their binary nature. In this report, we demonstrate that eeSNVs extracted from scRNA-seq data are ideal features to characterize cell subpopulations. Moreover, they provide a means to examine the relationship between eeSNVs and gene expression in the same scRNA-seq sample. Poirion, O., Zhu, X., Ching, T. et al.

> We have developed DENDRO, a statistical method for tumor phylogeny inference and clonal classification using scRNA-seq data. DENDRO accurately infers the phylogeny relating the cells and assigns each single cell from the scRNA-seq data set to subclone. DENDRO allows us to (1) cluster cells based on genetic divergence while accounting for transcriptional bursting, technical dropout, and sequencing error, as benchmarked by in silico mixture and a simulation analysis; (2) characterize the transcribed mutations for each subclone; and (3) perform single-cell multi-omics analysis by examining the relationship between transcriptomic variation and mutation profile with the same set of cells.
